        <summary>What is IT?</summary>
        <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of computers, storage, networking and other physical devices,
          infrastructure and
          processes to create, process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data. Typically, IT is used
          in the
          context of business operations, as opposed to the technology used for personal or entertainment purposes. The
          commercial
          use of IT encompasses both computer technology and telecommunications.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is Security?</summary>
        <p>There are two types in Security Subject. <br><b style="color: black;">Armed security guards</b>
          Usually carry firearms and have extensive training. They can use lethal force if necessary. Armed guards may
          be a good
          choice for areas with high violence rates, businesses that sell valuables, or private property. They may also
          provide
          specialized services like VIP protection. <br>
          <b style="color: black;">Unarmed security guards</b>
          Typically carry non-lethal weapons like batons, pepper spray, or tasers. They don't carry guns or other
          high-impact
          weapons. Unarmed guards may be a better choice if you have a budget, there's a police presence nearby, or you
          want to
          keep clients at ease. Their duties may include crowd control, bag searches, and patrolling buildings and
          grounds.
